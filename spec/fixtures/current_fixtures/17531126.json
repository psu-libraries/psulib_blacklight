In order to assess existing cavity heating models, two one-inch diameter cavities were flown on the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle during Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT1). These cavities were manufactured with depths of 1.0 in and 1.4 in, and they were both instrumented. Instrumentation included surface thermocouples upstream, downstream and within the cavities, and additional thermocouples at the TPS-structure interface. This paper will present the data obtained, and comparisons with computational predictions will be shown. Additionally, the development of a 3D material thermal model will be described, which will be used to account for the three-dimensionality of the problem when interpreting the data. Furthermore, using a multi-dimensional inverse heat conduction approach, a reconstruction of a time- and space-dependent flight heating distribution during EFT1 will be presented. Additional discussions will focus on instrumentation challenges and calibration techniques specific to these experiments. The analysis shown will highlight the accuracies and/or deficiencies of current computational techniques to model cavity flows during hypersonic re-entry.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"540\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"653\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\"0\"><subfield code=\"a\">Ground Support Systems and Facilities (Space); Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics; Spacecraft Design, Testing and Performance</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"700\" ind1=\"1\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Oliver, Brandon,</subfield><subfield code=\"e\">author.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"700\" ind1=\"1\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Amar, Adam,</subfield><subfield code=\"e\">author.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"700\" ind1=\"1\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Salazar, Giovanni,</subfield><subfield code=\"e\">author.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"700\" ind1=\"1\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Rezin, Marc,</subfield><subfield code=\"e\">author.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"793\" ind1=\"0\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Collection.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"856\" ind1=\"4\" ind2=\"1\"><subfield code=\"7\">0</subfield><subfield code=\"u\">http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20150019630</subfield><subfield code=\"z\">Connect to this object online.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"949\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Electronic resource</subfield><subfield code=\"w\">ASIS</subfield><subfield code=\"c\">1</subfield><subfield code=\"i\">17531126-1001</subfield><subfield code=\"l\">ONLINE</subfield><subfield code=\"m\">ONLINE</subfield><subfield code=\"r\">Y</subfield><subfield code=\"s\">Y</subfield><subfield code=\"t\">ONLINE</subfield><subfield code=\"u\">5/16/2016</subfield><subfield code=\"o\">.STAFF.

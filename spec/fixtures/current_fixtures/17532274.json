Referred to as the Proving Ground, this arena of exploration activities will enable the development of human spaceflight systems and operations to satisfy future exploration objectives beyond the cislunar environment. One option being considered includes the deployment of a habitable element or elements, which could be used as a central location for aggregation of supplies and resources for human missions in cislunar space and beyond. Characterizing candidate orbit locations for this asset and the impacts on system design and mission operations is important in the overall assessment of the options being considered. The orbits described in this paper were initially selected by taking advantage of previous studies conducted by NASA and the work of other authors. In this paper orbits are assessed for their relative attractiveness based on various factors. A set of constraints related to the capability of the combined Orion and SLS system to deliver humans and cargo to and from the orbit are evaluated. Deployed assets intended to spend multiple years in the Proving Ground would ideally require minimal station keeping costs to reduce the mass budget allocated to this function. Additional mission design drivers include eclipse frequency, potential for uninterrupted communication with deployed assets, thermal, attitude control, communications, and other operational implications. Also the ability to support potential lunar surface activities and excursion missions beyond EarthMoon space is considered. The results of the characterization and evaluation of the selected orbits indicate a Near Rectilinear Orbit (NRO) is an attractive candidate as an aggregation point or staging location for operations. In this paper, the NRO is further described in terms which balance a number of key attributes that favor a variety of mission classes to meet multiple, sometimes competing, constraints.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"540\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">No Copyright.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"653\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\"0\"><subfield code=\"a\">Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"700\" ind1=\"1\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Whitley, Ryan,</subfield><subfield code=\"e\">author.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"793\" ind1=\"0\" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Collection.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"856\" ind1=\"4\" ind2=\"1\"><subfield code=\"7\">0</subfield><subfield code=\"u\">http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20150013825</subfield><subfield code=\"z\">Connect to this object online.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag=\"949\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \"><subfield code=\"a\">Electronic resource</subfield><subfield code=\"w\">ASIS</subfield><subfield code=\"c\">1</subfield><subfield code=\"i\">17532274-1001</subfield><subfield code=\"l\">ONLINE</subfield><subfield code=\"m\">ONLINE</subfield><subfield code=\"r\">Y</subfield><subfield code=\"s\">Y</subfield><subfield code=\"t\">ONLINE</subfield><subfield code=\"u\">5/16/2016</subfield><subfield code=\"o\">.STAFF.

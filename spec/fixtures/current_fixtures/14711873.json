The neutron β-decay n → p + e⁻ + {bar ν}{sub e} + 783 keV into a proton, electron and electron antineutrino is the prototype semi-leptonic weak decay, involving both leptons and hadrons in the first generation of elementary particles. Within the standard V-A theory of weak interaction, it is governed by only two constants: the vector coupling constant g{sub V}, and axial vector constant g{sub A}. The neutron lifetime has been measured many times over decades, and the present (2004) world-average, τ{sub n} = 885.7 ± 0.8 s, has a weighted error of ≈0.1% while individual uncertainties are typically 2-10 seconds for high precision data. The highest precision claimed by an individual measurement is ≈0.15%. An improvement is required to resolve issues of the Standard Model of the electro-weak interaction as well as of astrophysics and of Big Bang theories. The focus in astrophysics is the solar neutrino deficit problem, which requires a precise value of g{sub A}. Big Bang theories require a precise τ{sub n}-value to understand the primordial He/H ratio. The strong interest of particle physicists in τ{sub n} is mainly based on a possible difficulty with the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which describes the mixing of quark mass states by the weak interaction. Nuclear, neutron, and pion decay data, probing the mixing amplitude V{sub ud} within the first quark generation, in combination with K and B meson decay data, which probe the second and third generation (V{sub us} and V{sub ub}), indicate a departure from the unitarity demanded by all gauge-invariant theories.

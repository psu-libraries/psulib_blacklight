This process is of much importance at hadron collider experiments due to its role as a background source in searches for Standard Model Higgs boson and single top-quark production. In this thesis the results are presented for a measurement of the b-jet cross-section in W{sup ±} + b{bar b} events containing 1 or 2 jets in 695 pb⁻¹ of √s =1.96 TeV p{bar p} collisions at the CDF experiment. This is the first measurement of the cross-section of W{sup ±} b{bar b} performed in any experiment. The cross-section is defined to be proportional to the number of b-jets from W{sup ±} b{bar b} events with one or two jets, and a leptonically decaying W{sup ±} with decay products passing kinematics cuts (p{sub T}(ℓ{sup ±}) ≥ 20.0 GeV, </subfield><subfield code=\" \">≤ 1.1, p{sub T}(ν) ≥ 25.0 GeV). The invariant mass distribution of jets identified as containing a long-lived hadron is fit with components for bottom, charm, and light-flavor to find the fraction due to true b-decays. Background b-jet sources are subtracted to isolate the contribution of W{sup ±} b{bar b} to the data.

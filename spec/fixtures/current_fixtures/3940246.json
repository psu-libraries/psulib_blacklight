The search found that the federal government funded more than 1,600 projects representing roughly $545 million in construction and building related R&amp;D.

Of the total, more than 500 projects representing roughly $236 million were potentially relevant to housing. Of housing-related R&amp;D investments, energy supply and energy efficiency represented roughly 65 percent of this funding. These activities were performed by nine departments and three independent agencies. For the broader construction and building portfolio, the Departments of Energy and Transportation together represented roughly 64 percent of the dollar investment.

In the case of the 3d and 4d transition metals, studies of copper, nickel, palladium, and silver, show that a model based on the assumption of direct interband transitions (direct-transition model) may be used, in conjunction with an appropriate final-state dispersion relation E{sub f}({rvec k}), to elucidate E{sub i}({rvec k}) for these materials along several high symmetry lines (primarily ΓΛL) in k-space. To answer this question more generally, we have undertaken an extensive study of the valence band structures of other transition metals along various k-space lines. To date, studies have been extended to the (111) faces of the 5d metals Pt and Au along with the Pt(100) ((5 x 20) surface structure) face, and the (110) and (100) faces of Ag. The experiments were all conducted at SSRL, using synchrotron radiation in the range 6 eV &lt; hν &lt; 34 eV. The results of these studies, combined with our previous Ag(111) work at these energies, allow us to invoke important conclusions concerning the relationships between ARP data, E{sub i}({rvec k}) and E{sub f}({rvec k}) for these materials. Several are summarized. For each crystal face investigated, the direct-transition model, along with a simple quasi-free-electron E{sub f}({rvec k}), was sufficient to determine experimental E{sub i}({rvec k}) relations along the appropriate k-space line that were in general agreement with theoretical RAPW band structure calculations.

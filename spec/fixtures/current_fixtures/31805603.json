Ranging through French, English, Italian, Russian and Japanese writing-particularly the stories of Guy de Maupassant, Henry James, Giovanni Verga, Anton Chekhov and Akutagàwa Ryünosuke-Goyet shows that these authors were able tocreate brilliant and successful short stories using the very simple 'tools of brevity' of that period. ln this challenging and far-reaching study, Goyet looks at classic short stories in the context in which they were read at the time: cheap newspapers and higher-end periodicills.

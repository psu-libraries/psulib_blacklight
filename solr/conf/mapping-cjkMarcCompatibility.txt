# the context of CJK vernacular scripts in bibliographic metadata.
# The list aims to unify searching for equivalent CJK characters that
# may have different Unicode encodings and/or presentation forms based
# on their input methods. It is derived from Princeton University
# Library's "IME variants not present in the EACC/MARC21 character
# sets" (https://library.princeton.edu/projects/eacc/oldindex.htm)
# and the Library of Congress Cataloging Policy and Support Office's
# CJK Compatibility Database (https://www.loc.gov/ils/cjk_search/cjk_cpso.html),
# both of which were created to support the work of catalogers and
# users of CJK scripts in MARC-21 records.

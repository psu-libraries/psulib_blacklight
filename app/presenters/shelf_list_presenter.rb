    #
    # 1) Querying from a known point forward:
    #    Returns a set of shelf items after a given key. The two items returned before the key are the item itself, and
    #    the previous item which is used to construct the link to the previous shelf.
    # 2) Querying from a known point backwards:
    #    Returns a set of shelf items before a given key. The one item that occurs after the key is used to construct
    #    the link to the next shelf.
    # 3) Looking from something nearby on the shelf, which may _or_ may not exist:
    #    Returns a set of shelf items such that the item we're looking for occurs *third* on the shelf. This is
    #    basically padding the results based on our minimum shelf length.
    # 4) Starting from the very beginning:
    #    Return only the items after the given key. A '0' query starts at the very beginning of the list.

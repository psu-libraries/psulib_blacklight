<h1>About</h1>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Here are some of the questions we've gotten about the Catalog:</p>

<p><strong>What about the CAT?</strong> Because the CAT was created on aging software, it retired at the end of Fall 2021. <%= link_to 'Learn more about the CAT retiring', 'https://news.psu.edu/story/673627/2021/10/22/academics/libraries-completes-online-catalog-update-will-retire-cat' %>.</p>

<p><strong>Can I find the same material as the CAT?</strong> Yes. The records in the Catalog and the legacy CAT are exactly the same.</p>

<p><strong>Is this replacing Lionsearch/Summon?</strong> No, but you will notice that "view in classic catalog" and "I Want It" links in Lionsearch point here instead of to the legacy CAT.</p>
